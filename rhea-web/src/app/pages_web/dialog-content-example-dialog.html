          Some user caveats are the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To visualize the constraints as a tree you have to select the corresponding text.</li>
            <li>When downloading the data it won't change the original file.</li>
            <li>It is advisable to make the changes as small as posible to avoid any mistake we could make. </li>
            <li>The order in wich you write constraints must be done as a tree model, so first, the root, and then if it has two childrens the first one should be the one who came before the logical preposition.
            Example: (A ^ B) will be written as ^AB. </li>
            <li>If unsure of the values selected try 'Write list' so you can see the current values, if any mistakes where made use 'Delete List' to start over or go ahead and then correct the mistake.</li>
            <li>If you try to change a value from a constraint, be sure of the number of references each type of term can have. The program allows you to put less references but you should then insert those values.</li>
            <li>The program adjust de values of the keys in the constraint dictionary when downloading as a json file.</li>
          </ul>
